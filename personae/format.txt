The format to create a persona file is a follows:

<Name of variable><space>=<space><value>

aka

<name> = <value>

for example:

PawnValueMg = 123
KnightValueEg = 321
KnightMobilityWt = 3

Any unmentioned term will have it's default value used.
The minimum and maximum values of each term are -10000 and +10000 respectively.
For ease of use, copy the 'default.txt' and modify the values as you please.
